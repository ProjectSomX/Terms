  * Service has no Warranty
  * We are not liable for your use of the service
  * Indemnification? You pay for attorney fees if your use of the service gets us sued (If we use this, it will help us dodge jerks trying to sue us, but it looks bad on the terms. Weâ€™ll need to consult a lawyer for this one)
